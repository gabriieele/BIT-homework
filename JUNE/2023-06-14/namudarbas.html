   <p>Gere made a notable departure from his traditional screen persona with <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Joseph Cedar</a>'s political drama <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank"><em>Norman</em></a> (2016). The film saw him portray Norman Oppenheimer, a small-time Jewish <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">fixer</a>. Gere himself described the character as an embodiment of the "sides of us we know are annoying and needy".<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank"><sup>[32]</sup></a> His portrayal of Oppenheimer was called "consistently, completely fascinating" by <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">RogerEbert.com</a><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank"><sup>[33]</sup></a> and was singled out as a worthy <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Academy Award</a> contender by <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank"><em>Variety</em></a>.<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>
